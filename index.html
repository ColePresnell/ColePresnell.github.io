            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img id="bioImage" src="images/headshot2.jpg" alt="Cole Presnell" />
            <p>Cole was born and raised in Fort Worth, TX, and in the summer of 2000 he moved to Austin to begin his first classes
                at the University of Texas. Shortly after graduating with two degrees, a BA in Philosophy and in Government,
                Cole met his lovely wife, Jessica, with whom he raises their two children, Henry and Vivienne.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Cole has had a diverse professional career. Working as a residential loan officer for the past five years, his
                professional philosophy emphasized customer service about all else: constant communication with his borrowers,
                remaining easily accessible for client questions, and a track record of moving through the loan process as
                quickly as possible.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Before entering the mortgage industry, Cole was a Proprietary Trader in the US equities market from 2009-2012,
                and, prior to that, worked as a Legislative Aid for the Texas House of Representatives.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In 2018, Cole began training to become a Full-Stack Web Developer at the University of Texas in Austin, and will
                be looking to work as a full-time developer in the summer of 2018.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In his spare time, Cole enjoys playing with his kids, watching football and baseball, and going to see movies at the Alamo
                Drafthouse on date nights with his wife. </p>
